v1.3
Minor change
Added link to "Show Hamclock"

v1.2
Based on R1CBU v0.31.2 Franco Venturi version

Hamclock control console is accessible at http://[IP of X6100]:8010
You can start/stop hamclock-web there instead of it running all the time.

Shut down the radio by holding the power button down for 5 seconds or longer.

This is a work of a non-programmer with a lot of help from AI and Googling. It is considered to be a quick and dirty hack. Expect to have various bugs. I take no responsibility if your radio becomes non-functional. Use it at your own risk.
